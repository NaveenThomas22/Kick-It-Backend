# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend API (.NET)

A clean, role-secured backend for an eCommerce application, built with .NET and JWT authentication.  
Designed with both user and admin roles, this backend manages products, orders, and users efficiently.

## 🚀 What It Does

- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** (Login / Register)
- 🧑‍💼 **Role-based Authorization** (Admin & User)
- 🛍️ Product CRUD (Admin)
- 🛒 Cart & Order Management
- 👥 User management (Admin can view and manage all users)
- 📦 Secure checkout and order placement

## 🎯 Why This Exists

I didn’t want to copy-paste. I wanted to understand and build.  
This project is my way of learning deeply — line by line — and building something **real** from scratch.
